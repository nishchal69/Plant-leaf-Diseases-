# Plant-leaf-Diseases-

I have used the data from kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset/code)

This project aims to identify diseases in plant leaves using machine learning techniques, which can help farmers and agricultural specialists take timely action to prevent crop damage. Leveraging a dataset of plant leaf images, this project applies image classification methods to detect and classify various plant diseases accurately.

Project Overview
Early detection of plant diseases can be crucial in preventing widespread agricultural damage. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze plant leaf images, identifying diseases based on visual symptoms.

Key Features
Dataset: Utilizes a well-curated dataset containing images of various plant diseases.
Preprocessing: Image data is preprocessed for model compatibility, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation to improve model accuracy.
Model: A CNN architecture tailored to image classification, optimizing parameters to enhance detection accuracy.
Evaluation: Assesses model performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure reliable detection.
Dependencies
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow/Keras
OpenCV
Matplotlib
NumPy
Usage
Data Preparation: Place your image dataset in the designated folder.
Run the Notebook: Execute each cell to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate the performance.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict diseases on new plant leaf images.
This project is an effective tool for automating the diagnosis of plant diseases, aiding the agriculture sector with timely insights and improving crop health.
